#+TITLE: Random Idle Quote

When emacs goes into idle mode, a random quote will appear in your
echo window. I use it to help me memorize keyboard shortcuts I am
working on in Emacs. You can use it for the same, to memorize any
random text you may be working on, or fill it with quotes to brighten
your day.

You can customize the 'quotes' shown by `M-X customize-group RET
random-idle-quotes RET`.

Quotes come pre-loaded from the Emacs Wiki Page
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsNiftyTricks.
