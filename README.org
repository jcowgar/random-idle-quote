#+TITLE: Random Idle Quote

When Emacs goes into idle mode, a random quote will appear in your
echo window.  Use it to help me memorize keyboard shortcuts, to
memorize any random text you may be working on, or fill it with
quotes to brighten your day.

Quotes come pre-loaded with tips from the Emacs Wiki Page [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsNiftyTricks][EmacsNiftyTricks]].

You can customize the quotes shown by `M-X customize-group RET
random-idle-quotes RET'.
